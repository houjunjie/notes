* **情节梳理**
1. “She led what was almost a double life. At Wuthering Heights, under Heathcliff's influence, she annoyed Hindley, laughed at Joseph, and was rude to me. But at Thrushcross Grange, which she often visited, she showed a different, calmer side of her character, and was polite, intelligent and amusing. The Lintons all liked her, and poor Edgar had fallen in love with her.”

原文出处：《第五章 凯瑟琳与艾加》

解读：Catherine这小丫头片子还有两副面孔呢！父母双亡，哥哥整日酗酒，疏于管教，她便过着双重生活。

在Wuthering Heights，她随心所欲，惹哥哥生气，取笑Joseph，对Ellen也很无礼；但到了经常去的Thrushcross Grange，她就表现出性格中恬静的一面，彬彬有礼，聪明幽默。

不知实情的Linton一家都非常喜欢她，单纯的Edgar也就渐渐沉沦，爱上了她。

2. “'Tell Ellen to say you're busy and can't see them,' he said. 'Those friends of yours take up all your time. You spend most of your evenings with them, not with me.'

'Well, why should I always spend my time with you?' she asked crossly. 'What can you talk about? How can you amuse me?'

'You never told me before that you didn't like my company, Catherine!' cried Heathcliff.”

原文出处：《第五章 凯瑟琳与艾加》
**解读：** 关于这一段描写，原著更有趣，和大家分享一下：
![描写](http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/mibMv72ib0sUO0AKSesonNLrzsX1YAfib5wib5jHHIsMfKqj0VvOticicjsq3fUT41td3sW3bPf2CpmPQvor9Bxl1Ihg/640?wx_fmt=png&tp=webp&wxfrom=5&wx_lazy=1)

“Almanac”是日历，“cross”就是过完一天在日历上画的那个叉（✖️），“dot”是点（●）。

这段描写大概是说，Heathcliff每天都会在日历上做记号，Catherine和Linton姐弟在一起的日子，他就画叉；和自己在一起的日子，他就画点。

读完笔者觉得Heathcliff有点萌，也能看出来他很喜欢和Catherine在一起的日子，希望她能多花点时间单独和自己待在一起。

3. “Just then we heard a horse outside, and there was a light knock on the door. Edgar Linton entered, his handsome face full of delight at receiving Catherine's unexpected invitation. I wondered if Catherine was comparing her two friends, as Edgar came in and Heathcliff ran out.”

原文出处：《第五章 凯瑟琳与艾加》

解读：出乎意料地收到Catherine的邀请，Edgar怀着激动的心情匆匆赶来，英俊的脸上更是满面春风。相比之下，刚刚才在喜欢的女孩儿面前受挫的Heathcliff显得有些黯然神伤。

Edgar像是个公子哥，英俊礼貌；而整天在农庄里干活的Heathcliff粗鲁无趣，不注意保持整洁。

连Ellen也搞不清，Catherine的内心是否在这一刻将同时出现在画面里的这两位小伙儿进行了比较。

4. “But as he could not stop looking at her, I knew there was no hope for him. Nothing would keep him away from her now. And sure enough, he came back into the room and shut the door. This time I left them alone, and stayed in the kitchen with little Hareton, but when I came to warn them that Hindley had returned, I realized that their quarrel had only brought them closer together.”

原文出处：《第五章 凯瑟琳与艾加》

解读：Edgar明明被Catherine狠狠地打了一耳光，却在见到她哭，听到她说赌气的话时心软了，站在门口犹豫不决，还忍不住看着Catherine。

少男少女的感情就是这么拉扯不清。笔者不经又想起了一句话：你打了我一巴掌，我不生气，还问你，你手怎么这么凉。啧啧啧……

而这场吵架反而使这两个年轻人的感情更进一步，甚至让他们抛弃了友谊的伪装，因为在乎而相信互相喜欢着对方。

下一章情节将有重大推进，暂不剧透～
